        <h2>Multi Platform</h2>

        <p>We believe that it is necessary to build an ecosystem on all significant platforms (such as PC, iOS, android) with transparent integration without compromising security. Most interestingly we provide mobile support for interactions with DAPPs through our applications on Android/iOS, creating a seamless experience for DAPP users. For users to interact right through their web browsers on their phones we are using a protocol similar to Web3 for integrations into standard mobile web browsers and our app MultiMask Mobile.</p>
        
        <h2>Multi Block-chains</h2>
        
        <p>We sincerely think that a wallet only for one blockchain has no future. People use different crypto-currencies and our mission is to make the interaction experience as simple as possible. We are also keen on creating a solution for interoperability by creating a wallet that will support DAPPs across multiple chains. This also means that devlopers and users will be able to access sidechains and layer2 solutions.</p>
        
        <h2>Off-Chain Protocols Support</h2>
        
        <p>We believe that supporting off-line protocols, such as web-based networking and online access, will provide additional opportunities for users to use the crypto currency in everyday life. Additionally itâ€™s a great solution for scalability, so we are sure it will have enough demand.</p>
